# Space of positive definite symmetric matrices

Given a point in the manifold (space of positive definite symmetric matrices), we show how to 
estimate the point using basis in its tangent space (space of symmetric matrices) through the exponential map. The mathematical detail is given in
[exponentialmap.pdf](https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/exp/blob/main/exponentialmap.pdf). Run the script [SCRIPT.m](https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/exp/blob/main/SCRIPT.m).
